There are two bins, A and B. Both bins have six positions in a straight line. Every position is either empty or contains a colored cube. You will be provided with two ordered lists of length six that describes the color of the cube at each position, or "empty" if the position is vacant.
I would like to move the fewest amount of cubes to fulfill the given goal. Your task is to output two new lists for bins A and B that meet this goal so that I can move the fewest number of blocks to reach this new state. A cube can only be moved into an empty position.
Ensure that the lists you give me are in the same format as the lists I gave you, both contain six elements, and all of the unmoved cubes are still in their original positions. Do not provide any explanation, only the raw lists.

Pairs of complementary colors are red and green, yellow and purple, orange and blue
To center the cubes, put them in the positions closest to the middle of the bin
