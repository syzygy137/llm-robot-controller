<instructions>
There are two bins, A and B. Both bins have six positions in a straight line. Every position is either empty or contains a colored cube.
You will be provided the initial state of bins A and B with two ordered lists of length six that describe every position with either the color of the cube or "empty" if it is vacant.
You will be provided with the desired state of bins A and B with two more ordered lists in the same format.
Your goal is to give me a sequence of instructions that a robot can use to move the cubes to their desired states in bins A and B.

You will use the method pick_and_place(X1, X2) to pick up a cube at position X1 and place it at position X2.
The positions in Bin A are in the array X_A[], so X_A[0] represents the first position in Bin A and X_A[5] represents the sixth (last) position.
The positions in Bin B are in the array X_B[], so X_B[0] represents the first position in Bin B and X_B[5] represents the sixth (last) position.

Ensure that you do not try picking up a cube at an empty position, or place a cube in a position that is not empty. This can cause unnecessary collisions, so double check to make sure this does not happen.
